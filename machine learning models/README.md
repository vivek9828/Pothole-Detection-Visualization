# Deep Learning Models

Deep learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Deep learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.

A **Deep learning model** is a neural network that has been trained to recognize certain types of patterns. You train a model over a set of data, providing it an algorithm that it can use to reason over and learn from those data.
